# Weather-App
I created a visually appealing Blue Gradient Square Circle-themed weather web application. This project uses modern web design with gradient effects and responsive styling. The core functionality involves:

🌍 Auto-detecting user location using Geolocation API
🔍 User-inputted city search for flexibility
🌤️ Fetching real-time weather data from a Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap)
🌡️ Displaying temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and more

his project demonstrates my skills in:
Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
API Integration
Responsive Design
UI/UX creativity with custom gradients and layout aesthetics
