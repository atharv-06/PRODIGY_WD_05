# Weather-App
I created a visually appealing *Blue Gradient Square Circle-themed* weather web application. This project uses modern web design with gradient effects and responsive styling. The core functionality involves:

🌍 *Auto-detecting user location* using Geolocation API <br>
🔍 *User-inputted city search* for flexibility  <br>
🌤️ *Fetching real-time weather data* from a Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) <br>
🌡️ Displaying temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and more <br>

his project demonstrates my skills in:
Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) <br>
API Integration <br>
Responsive Design <br>
UI/UX creativity with custom gradients and layout aesthetics <br>
